llm_chains.py
-------------
All the "thinking" for the quiz tutor lives here, built with LangChain.

The shape of every function below:
  1. A Pydantic model defines the exact JSON structure we want back from
     the LLM (e.g. {"score": 7, "feedback": "...", "next_question": "..."}).
     This is LangChain's "structured output" feature - the model is forced
     to return exactly that shape via tool-calling under the hood, instead
     of us parsing free text with regex.
  2. A ChatPromptTemplate defines a "system" message (the LLM's persistent
     role/behaviour) plus a "human" message template with {placeholders}.
  3. `prompt | structured_llm` is LangChain's pipe syntax: "take the
     prompt's output and feed it into the model." `.invoke({...})` runs
     the chain once and returns an already-parsed Pydantic object.
